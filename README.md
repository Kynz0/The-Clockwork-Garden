This is my modpack that can be found [here](https://modrinth.com/modpack/the-clockwork-garden) when released.
# Focus
I just tried my best to make a **cozy** modpack with **farming** in mind. I went a long way to polish every detail (and will continue to do so), including **performance**, gameplay and **ambiance**.
I will be hosting a server for this modpack soon after full release, contact me on [discord](https://discord.gg/g6KQPyrhJv) if you'd like to join.
