This is my modpack that can be found [here](https://modrinth.com/modpack/the-clockwork-garden) when released.
# Focus
I just tried my best to make a **cozy** modpack with **farming** in mind. I went a long way to polish every detail (and will continue to do so), including **performance**, gameplay and **ambiance**.
I will be hosting a server for this modpack soon after full release, contact me on [discord](https://discord.gg/g6KQPyrhJv) if you'd like to join.

- In total there is 128 of mods installed (as of writing this) with most of them being little tweaks to the game to make it more immersive, ambient and cozy
## Changes to vanilla:
There are many things I've modified or removed from the vanilla game, to make it more interesting even for og players that know every trick.
- Revamped Enchanting with [Immersive Enchanting](https://modrinth.com/mod/immersive-enchanting)
- Changed the End and its utilities entirely:
	- It is so much harder to get to the end
	- There is a new armor/tools tier: Enderite, found in the end
	- The dragon fight is harder
	- Elytra is completely disabled outside the End dimension
	- Ender chests are disabled
- Revamped sleeping mechanics with [Sleep Tight](https://modrinth.com/mod/sleep-tight)
- Lot of villager mechanics don't work the same:
	- Iron golem farms massively nerfed (they still work the same, just much slower)
	- Classic villager trading halls won't work anymore
	- Totems only drop from evokers in the mansion (you can't get them from raids)
- Moon phases: the moon now has some new lunar events
- And many more! (come find out :P)
## QoL
I've focused quite a lot on adding many quality of life features, to make the gameplay nicer and smoother.
- All the ores glow now!
- New items are highlighted in inventory
- Way better and more useful F5
- Much more readable F3 stripped of all the bloat
- Immersive vanilla style backpacks!
